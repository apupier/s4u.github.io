A few days ago I decided to prepare own website.
Because I'm not web developer I looking for something easy and ready to use for web layout.

On the other hand, I'm a developer so I like to write a few lines of code by myself.

After some searching I choosed those tools for build website:

* GitHub Pages for hosting
* Jekyll for site generating
* Bootstrap CSS for build the layout

<!-- -->

### The required software
 * Ruby - *I had problem with version 2 - so I installed 1.9*
 * Jekyll
 * Python

There are plenty of sites which describe how to install them.

### Jekyll
Of course before begin work with Jekyll you should read the documentation.

Next point is look into some projects which use Jekyll.
Good and simple example is [jekyll-bootstrap](https://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap)
I took some ideas from this project.

You can also look into source code of my site, it is stored on github [here](https://github.com/s4u/s4u.github.io).

### Site layout
It was the most difficult task for me.
I don't know too many colors and so on ... so I had some concerns about website design.

When I tried Bootstrap everything became much easier.
Bootstrap has a lot of examples and good documentation - I can recommend this framework it is very cool.

So now you see how it works and look.

Here are some links that have helped me during the works:
