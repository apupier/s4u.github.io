We announce that next version `2.0.0` of SLF4J mock library has been released.

<!-- -->

### New feature in this release:

 - project refactor
 - correct misspelled package name
 - new way for define mock, now we use standard `Mockito` annotation do define `Mocks` and `Spies` for `Loggers`
 - `Mock` will be created only when user declare it in test, old version created `Mocks` and recorded invocations for all Loggers
 - `Mocks` are bind to current thread, so testing the same `Logger` in parallel is possible
 - all the Magic are done by `Mockito` plugins, so you don't need to directly use class from this library

Detail release info can be found at github [v2.0.0](https://github.com/s4u/slf4j-mock/releases/tag/v2.0.0).
